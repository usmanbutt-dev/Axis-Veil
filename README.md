![Axis Veil Banner](assets/banner.png) <!-- Optional: replace with actual image path -->

**Developer:** Muhammad Usman Butt  
**Engine:** Unity 3D (URP)  
**Game Type:** Third-Person Puzzle RPG  
**Target Platform:** PC (Expandable to Console)

---

## 🌌 Overview

**Axis Veil** is a third-person, story-driven puzzle RPG set in a world fractured by gravitational catastrophe. Players embody a rare being—**a Gravitybound**—with the ability to invert gravity at will, both for themselves and for objects. Through puzzle-platforming, light combat, and a progression system, players uncover the mysteries hidden beyond the gravitational veil.

## 🎮 Core Features

- **Gravity Inversion** – Flip between ceiling and floor to traverse broken worlds.
- **Object-Specific Manipulation** – Invert gravity for chosen objects with precision.
- **Physics-Based Puzzles** – Solve challenges that rely on motion, weight, and inversion timing.
- **Plane-Dependent Enemies** – Encounter foes that exist only in specific gravity states.
- **Skill Tree System** – Unlock abilities like Gravity Pulse, Object Flip, and more.
- **Narrative Exploration** – Discover the fate of a collapsed civilization through ruins, fragments, and lore.

---

## 🧪 Prototype Goals

- Implement base gravity inversion mechanics.
- Enable gravity flipping for tagged objects.
- Integrate puzzle triggers and level scripting.
- Prototype a skill unlock and XP system.
- Introduce light combat elements.
- Deliver a playable vertical slice (Cradle Ruins level).

## 🗺️ Level: Cradle Ruins

> The prototype level teaches inversion mechanics through staged puzzles and environment storytelling.

**Sections Include:**
- *The First Flip* – Learn gravity shift through simple traversal.
- *Weight of the World* – Use an inverted crate to activate pressure plates.
- *Mirror Room* – Switch gravity planes to solve a mirrored layout.
- *Enemy Gate* – Defeat gravity-plane-specific enemies with puzzle-based interaction.

## ⚙️ Systems Overview

| System | Purpose |
|--------|---------|
| Gravity Manager | Controls global and object-based gravity direction. |
| Player Controller | Custom movement handling with inverted physics. |
| Object Inversion | Handles tag detection, inversion logic, and transitions. |
| Puzzle Interactions | Door triggers, pressure plates, time-based switches. |
| Skill Tree | UI, skill unlocks, XP tracking. |
